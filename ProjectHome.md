[Freeciv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeciv) is a multiplayer, turn-based strategy game for workstations and personal computers inspired by the commercial proprietary Sid Meier's Civilization series. The game's default settings are closest to Civilization II, both in gameplay and graphics (including the units and the isometric grid).

Jfreeciv is a freeciv clone written in Java program language. The goal of this project is to provide a out-of-box cross-platform game for Civilization fans. Think about it, you can play it in any platform support java. One day, maybe you can run server, play game in browser, or cell phone!
